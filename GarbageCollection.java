Que. Explain the concept of garbage collection? 
or 
Que.Explain the finalize method of Java language? 
Answer: 
Garbage Collection: Automatic de-allocation of memory of object whenever execution control 
D 
comes out of the block in which the object is declared is known as garbage collection. 
Whenever any object is declared or created within the block then scope of that object will 
be local to the block and life of object will end after the complete execution of block. Java does not 
provide destructor or any type of delete operator to delete or free the allocated memory but the de 
allocation operation is automatically performed by java interpreter whenever the execution control 
comes out of the block in which the object is declared. To perform the de-allocation operation, java 
interpreter always invokes finalize() method whenever the scope of object ends, finalize() method is 
natural, inbom native of Object class that is always available in all the classes. To perform resource free operation in 
user defined class, java developer can override the finalize() method and clean or free the resources 
of class. 
Java can also convert the unused blocks of memory into free space by using the static method gc() of System class. After the garbage collection operation using gc() method, free memory 
space of program will automatically increased. 
Que.Explain this keyword of java language with suitable example? 
Answer: 
'this' is standard keyword of java language that represents the reference of currently invoking object and it is used to access member variable, methods and constructors of invoking 
object. 'this' keyword is accessible only in non-static method and constructors where as it is not 
allowed in static block or static method. 
Note: In java language, this is not a pointer. 
this variable 
Example: 
class Data 
private int a; 
public Data(int a) 
a=a; 
public void show() 
System.out.println("Value="+a); 
class Use Me 
public static void main(String args[]) 
Data d1=new Data(10); 
OV 
d1.show(); 
Output: 
Value=0 
In the above example, Data class contain parameterized constructor initializing the value of member variable â€˜a' but both the source and target variable will represent the local variables only. During the execution of parameterized constructor of Data class, execution control will access the 
value of variable 'a' from the local variable and not from the class level variable i.e. constructor will 
not initialize the member variable of object d1. 
To solve the above problem, we have to use the 'this' keyword as show below. 
Example: 
class Data 
private int a; public Data(int a) 
this.a=a; 
public void show() 
System.out.println("Value="+a); 
class UseMe 
public static void main(String args[]) 
Data d1=new Data(10); d1.show(); 
Output: 
Value=10 
In the above example, this keyword represents the reference of invoking object and accessing the member variable of object. 
this method 
Example: 
class Data 
private int a; 
public Data(int a) 
this.ara; 
this.show(); 
public void show() 
System.out.println("Value="+a); 
class UseMe 
public static void main(String args[]). 
Data d1=new Data(10); 
d1.show(); 
Output: 
Value=10 
Value=10 
this constructor 
Example: 
class Data 
private int a; 
public Data() 
{ 
this(10); 
public Data(int a) 
this.a=a; 
public void show(). 
System.out.println("Value="+a); 
pe 
class UseMe 
public static void main(String args[]) 
Data dl=new Data(); d1.show(); 
Output: 
Value=10
